Testing Guide for Career Mentor Bot

1. Start the Backend (Flask Server)
   - Open a terminal
   - Navigate to project root directory
   - Run: `python app.py`
   - Should see: "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5173"
   - Keep this terminal running

2. Start the Frontend (Vite Server)
   - Open a new terminal
   - Navigate to project root directory
   - Run: `npm run dev`
   - Should see a URL like: "Local: http://localhost:5173/"
   - Keep this terminal running

3. Test the Form Submission
   - Open browser to http://localhost:5173/userinput
   - Open browser's Developer Tools (F12 or right-click -> Inspect)
   - Go to Console tab to monitor for errors
   - Fill out the form with test data:
     * Email (required): test@example.com
     * Name: Test User
     * Age: 25
     * Work Type: remote/hybrid/onsite
     * Fill other fields as desired
   - Click Submit
   - Check Console for any error messages
   - Check Flask terminal for incoming request logs

4. Common Issues & Solutions
   a. "Failed to submit form" error:
      - Check both servers are running
      - Verify Flask server shows debug output when form is submitted
      - Check browser console for specific error message
      - Ensure email field is filled (it's required)
   
   b. CORS errors:
      - Verify CORS settings in app.py match your frontend URL
      - Both http://localhost:5173 and http://127.0.0.1:5173 should be allowed

   c. Database errors:
      - Check if database.db exists in project root
      - If not, stop Flask server and delete database.db
      - Restart Flask server (it will create a new database)

5. Verify Data Storage
   - After successful submission, check database:
     * Visit: http://localhost:5173/get_users
     * Should see JSON array of all submitted users

Debug Tips:
- Frontend logs are in browser console
- Backend logs are in Flask terminal
- Database is SQLite file: database.db
